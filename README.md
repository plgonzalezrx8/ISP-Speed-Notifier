#I'm extremely annoyed at my ISP!

Their service has been extremely inconsistent, speeds fluctuating drastically
through the day, so I decided to create this tool in order to document how
inconsistent their service is. I will add options for others to use this as
well, for example, receive SMS notifications when speed significantly below
of what you should get, or Tweet at the company with a screenshot of the 
speed test when it is too slow.
